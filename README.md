# README

This repository contains the script python that can help you in the analysis of your repository git.

To use it, just set the variable 

```
folder_name = "/path/to/your/git_repo"
```
at line 61.

The figure plot is saved as a `.svg` (so, open it with Inkscape for example). 

An example of the output figure can be the following figure:

![Analysis](https://github.com/leos313/python_git_analysis/blob/master/analysis.png)

As you can see, it was used on a git repo where the master brach has 84 commits.

Fell free to re-use the script and please cite the current work.

The idea of writing down this script come from [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60321741/automatically-count-the-modification-for-instance-added-deleted-letters-along).

*It was made just for fun. If you want to contribute, enhancing the little project (for instance some idea can be [1] managing and analyzing multiple branch and not only `master`, or [2] adding a minimal GUI), it will be a pleasure to test your improvements.*

Ragards,

*Leonardo Suriano*
